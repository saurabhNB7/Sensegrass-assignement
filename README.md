# Sensegrass-assignment
In this repository, I have worked on the assignment given by Sensegrass to derieve insights from the data of a wine store. The dataset containes various columns such as user_name of the reviewer, country (from where wine is), review title and review details, points given to the wine by the user, province or state from which the wine is from, winery (winery that made the wine). I am attaching in detail description of the columns above in word file. The target variable is the variety column (which is type of grapes used to make the wine). 
Note : As I have used plotly for visualization, if the visualization is not visible, kindly download the notebook.
